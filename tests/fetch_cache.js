You know the idea that there was an original perfection from which you fell and had to be redeemed doesn’t make a lot of sense if you see life as emerging over 13.8 billion years from the beginning of this universe. And so we’ve got to begin to lift what I think is the Christ experience out of the explanations of antiquity, and then find a new way to make that experience live, and I think we do this in other areas of life all the time, but we don’t know how to do this in religion.\n\n> — [https://youtu.be/LnDOsdDI9Vs?t=95](https://youtu.be/LnDOsdDI9Vs?t=95)",
