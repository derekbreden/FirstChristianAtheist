      <h2>Bishop John Shelby Spong</h2>

      <p quote>
        The church is still caught in pre-Darwinian pre-Copernican categories.
        The idea that we were born in sin is a very strange idea when you’re
        past Darwin. You know the idea that there was an original perfection
        from which you fell and had to be redeemed doesn’t make a lot of sense
        if you see life as emerging over 13.8 billion years from the beginning
        of this universe. And so we’ve got to begin to lift what I think is the
        Christ experience out of the explanations of antiquity, and then find a
        new way to make that experience live, and I think we do this in other
        areas of life all the time, but we don’t know how to do this in
        religion.<br />

      <h2>Acceptance</h2>

      <p>
        Christianity as it is today does not accept unrepentant atheists, with
        the exception of Unitarian Universalists whose services are targetted
        towards a theistic audience, focusing on the joys of worshipping God
        together.
      </p>

      <p>
        Perhaps here we can have a sanctuary, for those few of us who have
        something we wish to salvage from the wreckage that is Christianity's
        encounter with the modern age, some value that we seek to carry forward
        without the theistic baggage.

      <h2>My personal testimony</h2>

      <p>
        At age 6 I was given a choice to believe in Jesus or not. It was likely
        I had heard much about religion prior to this, but this is the first
        time I remember where I had some role of my own in the situation. I
        didn't understand what it would mean to believe, but I thought it was
        something that I could choose to do.
      </p>

      <p>At age 9 I asked to be baptized, and I was.</p>

      <p>
        At age 10 I was introduced to hypocrisy in the church, through the book
        "In His Steps" by Charles Sheldon, which asked the question "What would
        Jesus do?" Common church behavior did not live up to Sheldon's
        expectations, and I was able to see the "othering" happening in my own
        church, particularly towards unbelievers and what could be done to reach
        them, to help them repent of their unbelief.
      </p>

      <p>
        At age 12 God spoke to me and said that he was an idea invented by man,
        changed over thousands of years.
      </p>

      <p>
        I slowly felt alienated with other Christians, that the things I said
        and did were not understood by them. That what I understood Christianity
        to be about, unconditional love for all, was not what they understood
        Christianity to be about. For them it was about John 3:16. For me it was
        about Galations 5:14.
      </p>

      <p>
        At age 23 I had a conversation with a former worship leader and friend,
        just a couple years older than me, that ended with him telling me that I
        was talking to the wrong person, that he was not the one I needed to
        talk to. I asked him who I needed to talk to? He said “I don’t know”.
        Earlier in our conversation, he told me that faith was important. I said
        I don’t know that. I asked him why is faith important? He said we grew
        up in the same church, how could I not know?
      </p>

      <p>
        At age 28 I had another religious experience. It was clear to me that I
        was seeing signs in the real world that corresponded to my thoughts, as
        if the universe were reading my mind and all the events around me were
        arranged to affirm my beliefs. Much like the bird that flew in and out
        of the church at my grandmother's funeral that meant so much to my
        mother, her own mother's soul saying goodbye, I was seeing meaningful
        birds of this sort everywhere.
      </p>

      <p>
        At no point did I ever see evidence of anything supernatural. I did have
        a repeat of my younger experiences, seeing and hearing God through my
        own imagination and my interpretation of the events around me, words of
        others I heard, words I found. I saw again how the most innocuous of
        coincidences with a little confirmation bias and motivated reasoning
        (where we ignore the tidal wave of events happening all the time, and
        instead focus on a few coincidences that can be seen as responses and
        confirmation of thoughts and prayers), I saw how this confirmation bias
        can be strong and convincing evidence that prayers are being answered
        always. I heard voices clearly, but they were also all very clearly
        generated by own mind, and in no way different from the ordinary inner
        monologue and imagination of what others might say, that we are all
        (almost all) familiar with.
      </p>

      <p>
        The only difference was that during this episode the mundane took on
        special significance. I was able to see how (in a way that had been
        difficult for me to do for a long time) an adult could find themselves
        believing in the supernatural, even as I still failed to do so myself.
      </p>

      <p>
        At age 38 I found Bishop John Shelby Spong. Finally, here was someone
        who thought Christianity was about what I thought it was about,
        unconditional love. John says it as “living life fully, loving
        wastefully, with no expectation of reward.” There is no need to say
        anything about sin, to ask anyone for mercy, to exclude anyone from
        being included in the Church.
      </p>

      <p>
        And so I have some hope for the future of Christianity, to eventually be
        inclusive of those like myself who are not theists.
